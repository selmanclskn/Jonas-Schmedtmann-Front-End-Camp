      All modern websites and web applications are built using three
      <em>fundamental</em>
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web.

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
      <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language
      that web developers use to structure and describe the content of webpage
      (not a programming language)
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraph, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML, each elements is made up of 3 parts:
      <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual elements</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can learn more at the <a href="#">MDN Web Docs.</a></p>
